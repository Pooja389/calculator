# Python Calculator

## Description

This is a simple command-line calculator built in Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The calculator allows users to continue calculations with the result or start a new calculation.

## How to Use

1. The calculator starts by asking the user to input the first number.
2. The user then selects an arithmetic operation (%, /, -, +, *).
3. The user inputs the second number.
4. The calculator computes and displays the result.
5. The user can then choose to:
   - Continue the calculation with the result (`y`).
   - Start a new calculation (`n`).
   - Exit the calculator (`e`).

2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the following command:
